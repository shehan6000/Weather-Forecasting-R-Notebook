# Weather Forecasting R Notebook

This R notebook provides a comprehensive guide to collecting and analyzing weather forecast data. The project includes various files that are essential for the data collection and analysis process.

## Project Files

- `cities_weather_forecast.xlsx`: Contains weather forecast data for different cities.
- `lab-jupyter-data-collection-april.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for data collection via API calls.
- `raw_seoul_bike_sharing.xlsx`: Raw data file for bike-sharing statistics in Seoul.
- `raw_worldcities.xlsx`: Raw data file containing information about world cities.

## Data Collection

The Jupyter notebook (`lab-jupyter-data-collection-april.ipynb`) is used to collect weather forecast data through API calls. This data is then stored in the `cities_weather_forecast.xlsx` file for further analysis.

## Data Analysis

The collected data is analyzed to understand weather patterns and their potential impact on bike-sharing demand. The analysis is performed using the R programming language, and the results are stored in the `raw_seoul_bike_sharing.xlsx` and `raw_worldcities.xlsx` files.

## Usage

To run the R notebook, you will need to have R and Jupyter installed on your system. Ensure that all the required packages are installed and that you have the necessary API keys to fetch the weather data.
